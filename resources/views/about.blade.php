        VATSIM is a community of around 200.000 members who share a passion for aviation.
        It makes no difference whether you want to be at the controls of the latest airliner, or experience the rush of managing chaotic airspace, VATSIM is the place to do just that.
        VATSIM is made for individuals, so the voice you hear on your headset when on final approach into London Heathrow is an actual person and not a computer generated voice.
        In addition, VATSIM is a collection of aviation enthusiasts and you’ll find that people will do whatever they can to help newbies and ensure that all members have fun.
        You can also expect your circle of friends to become larger as you meet new people who share the same passion as you. VATEMEA consists of 6 divisions which are:

        <br><br>

        <strong>VATEUD</strong> – European (Except UK) Division <br>
        <strong>VATUK</strong> – United Kingdom Division <br>
        <strong>VATRUS</strong> – Russian Division <br>
        <strong>VATMENA</strong> – Middle East and North Africa Division <br>
        <strong>VATIL</strong> – Israel Division <br>
        <strong>VATSAF</strong> - South African Division <br>
        <br>
        VATEMEA is home to thousands of controllers and even more pilots as well as Virtual Airlines. Our objective is to provide professional Air Traffic Control while ensuring a fun and friendly environment for all in our airspace.
        VATEMEA has jurisdiction over the greatest landmass and airspace in the world.
        Whether you want to fly an airliner from the Middle East to Britain, take a slow and lazy VFR flight in the Mediterranean or want to become an Air Traffic Controller at any one of the busiest airports in the world, VATEMEA is your home.
